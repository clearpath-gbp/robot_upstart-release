ros-kinetic-robot-upstart (0.1.1-0xenial) xenial; urgency=high

  * Python Rewrite
  * The startup event is too early for ROS to start, use local-filesystems instead.
  * Remove bash versions of the install and uninstall utilities.
  * Add support for supplying the --wait flag to roslaunch.
  * Add Sphinx documentation.
    To get the argparse docs required moving most of the install
    script to a module, which probably should have been done anyway.
  * Add a new-implementation install script, refactor Provider to be a class rather than function.
  * Add roslint.
  * Initial implementation of Python job generator.
  * Port templated files to use empy.
    This gets rid of the bespoke templating system that was so bad. Also
    notable here is adding a --root flag to install somewhere other than
    the actual root. This needs to be further fleshed out, for example
    by not reinvoking with sudo when installing to non-root location.
  * use LANG=C for ifconfig
  * add argument to specify log directory
